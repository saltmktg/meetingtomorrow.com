= Reasons for choosing Nelio =

Take a look at the following reasons for choosing
Nelio A/B Testing!


= #1 - Native A/B Testing Solution for WordPress =

There's no [need to learn an external
tool](https://nelioabtesting.com/5-reasons-use-nelio-ab-testing/?fp=wordpress.org).
Define, manage, and track the progress of your experiments directly from within
WordPress. Nelio A/B Testing provides a **lovely and well-known user
interface** that simplifies the process of creating alternatives and applying
the winning ones.


= #2 - Create Alternative Content for your Pages, Posts, and Custom Post Types =

When creating A/B experiments, the first things you'll want to test are the
pages of your website. Does this button work? Do my visitors go from the
landing page to my pricing page? What if I change this background image? Nelio
A/B Testing makes [page (and post) experiments super
easy](https://nelioabtesting.com/wordpress-splitmultivariate-testing-pages/?fp=wordpress.org)!

Moreover, **version 4.1** includes support for custom post types. Use Nelio A/B
Testing with any plugin that defines its own custom post types (such as
_Products_, _Videos_, _Reviews_, and more).


= #3 - Go beyond simple title tests&mdash;Test Headlines! =

Are you a Publisher? Are you an avid blogger? Then, you probably want to
[deliver to every reader a more engaging and relevant reading
experience](https://nelioabtesting.com/nelio-ab-testing-publishers/?fp=wordpress.org).
Nelio A/B Testing includes is **the first A/B testing tool for WordPress that
offers Headline Experiments**. Given a post in your site, create alternative
titles, excerpts, and featured images, and discover which combination gets more
visitors to click the link and further read the post from anywhere in your
site!


= #4 - Test Widgets =

**Nelio A/B Testing is the only solution that includes Menu and Widget
Testing**. Use the WordPress' default user interface for creating new menus and
widget sets. You'll be able to duplicate your current menus and widgets, and
modify them with just a few clicks. Discover which combination improves your
conversion rate!


= #5 - Beautiful Heatmaps and Click-maps =

**[Heatmaps (and Click-maps) offer valuable
information](https://nelioabtesting.com/heatmaps-teach-us/?fp=wordpress.org)
about what your visitors do and don't do** when they land to your website.
Also, they are a perfect companion of A/B experiments, for they give insights
on what to text next and help you understand the progress of your experiments.


= #6 - Test Alternative Themes and CSS =

If you're planning to change your theme, or tweak its CSS rules, [make sure
they'll benefit your
business](https://nelioabtesting.com/add-ab-testing-clause-next-design-contract/?fp=wordpress.org).
Nelio A/B Testing makes theme and CSS testing extremely easy! Simply select
the themes you want to test (or define the alternative CSS rules you want to
apply), and the plugin will take care of the rest.


= #7 - Conversion Actions and Evolution of Your Experiments =

With Nelio A/B Testing, you can [track the important actions your visitors
take](https://nelioabtesting.com/powerful-analytics/?fp=wordpress.org). Don't
get lost with tons of irrelevant options and data. Focus on what matters. Our
plugin will offer you fresh information about the evolution of the experiment,
with nice graphics about visitors and conversions.


= #8 - Cache Support and Server Load =

One of our priorities is **efficiency**. The process of A/B testing a site is
not necessarily at odds with performance. Nelio A/B Testing implements several
mechanisms to reduce the impact of testing your site, such as a **Performance
Must-Use Plugin** (that reduces response times of any AJAX request triggered by
Nelio), **support for cache systems** in WordPress, and **optional site-wide
consistency** (if you're testing a page or post, not only that page or post has
to change, but also any page that includes a widget referencing it).


= #9 - Outstanding Support =

We work very hard to offer an amazing support to all our customers. If you
encounter compatibility issues or you have problems setting the plugin up and
running, contact us and we'll do our best to help you!


= #10 - Subscription Plans that Fit Your Needs =

Nelio A/B Testing aims to offer a **complete A/B testing experience for
everybody**. That's why [you can create an **unlimited number of experiments of
any kind** subscribing to any of our
packages](https://nelioabtesting.com/subscription-plans/?fp=wordpress.org). Just
check our subscription plans and select the one that better suits your needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use an A/B Testing Solution specifically designed for WordPress? =

* **Smooth learning curve.** There is no need to learn yet another tool.
Everything (from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is
done from the WordPress dashboard you are familiar with, resulting in a
well-known, perfectly integrated user interface.
* **Evolve your WordPress site easily.** A native WordPress solution automates
and simplifies the evolution of your site. Consider, for example, applying the
winner alternative in your site as soon as the results are statistically
significant. With a native solution, this is as easy as clicking one single
button. With a generic tool, on the other hand, you would have to manually
modify the page so that it integrates the changes you created in the (winning)
alternative.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The "testing unit" in a generic tool is the web
page, since the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access to.
A native WordPress solution, however, permits you to test any WordPress
specific component, such as posts, pages, CSS, themes, child themes, and many
more coming!

== Changelog ==

= 4.3.3 (February 8, 2016) =
* **Improvement**. When loading content using AJAX, the function is now more
reliable and it is more difficult that third-party components "break" it.
* **Improvement**. Testing scripts are slightly faster and can be cached by
your visitors' browsers.
* **WooCommerce 2.1 Fix.** [Thanks to
@pyramusnl](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/issue-with-woocommerce-21),
Nelio now works properly with WooCommerce 2.1.
* **Bug Fix.** Instead of using `wp_json_encode`, we now use `json_encode`.
The former function is recommended, but it's only available on WordPress
4.1+. [Thanks to @pyramusnl for reporting the
bug](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problem-wp_json_encode-with-wp-383).


= 4.3.2 (December 14, 2015) =
* **Improvement**. From now on, if you share the link of a tested post, and
the link includes the testing parameters (such as `nab=1`), these will be
ignored when opened. If you want to "force" that alternative, include a
param named `nabforce`.
* **Improvement.** You can now duplicate scheduled experiments.
* **Improvement.** New implementation of the running experiments cache, which
is faster and more reliable.
* **Bug fix.** You can no longer run two different WooCommerce Product
Summary experiments that are testing the same product.
* Some minor fixes.

= 4.3.1 (November 27, 2015) =
* **Disqus Compatibility**. We added [Disqus config
script](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472098) for loading
the appropriate comment thread. If you want to use page IDs, use the following
filter: `nelioab_use_page_id_in_disqus`. Its parameter specifies whether the
page ID should be included or not.
* **New Feature**. The plugin is now available to all your WordPress users
with, at least, an _Editor_ role. If you need to modify this behavior, use the
filter named `nelioab_can_user_manage_plugin`, which takes one boolean
parameter and returns another one: whether the current user can (or cannot)
manage the plugin.
* **New Feature**. When testing posts, you can now hide the original discussion
in your alternatives and test whether comments have an impact in your
conversion rates or not.
* **Improvement**. You can now run Heatmap Experiments on your _WooCommerce
Products_.
* **Bug fix**. You can now track Heatmaps for your _WooCommerce Product_ (the
dropdown selector we included didn't show any _products_ on previous versions
of the plugin).
* **Bug fix**. In the progress of the experiment page, WooCommerce
Order-Completed Conversion Actions where shown as Phone Calls. This is now
fixed.


= 4.3.0 (October 27, 2015) =
* **New Conversion Action&mdash;Compatibility with ResponseTap**. Nelio A/B
Testing is now compatible with [ResponseTap](https://www.responsetap.com/),
a call-tracking service. From now on, you can use your customers' actual calls
in a split test and count them as conversions!
* **Possible Speed Improvement**. We use a higher priority when enqueuing our
tracking scripts, so that they appear as soon as possible in your website. This
way, they can kick in earlier, and, should your visitor see some alternative
content, the plugin redirects her to the appropriate version faster.
* Nelio A/B Testing requires WordPress version 3.5.


= 4.2.10 (September 29, 2015) =
* **Bug fix**. Headline and WooCommerce Product Summary Experiments didn't show
their results properly. Progress summary shows the status of the experiment,
graphics of the winning alternative are properly highlighted, and experiment's
running time is correct.


= 4.2.9 (September 25, 2015) =
* **Bug fix**. Version 4.2.4 introduced an improved navigation system to reduce
load times by inserting Nelio's testing parameters to URLs. The generated links
were invalid for CSS, Menu, Theme, and Widget experiments. This version fixes
this.
* Added new filter: `nelioab_order_status_for_conversions`. Previous versions
of the plugin only counted as a conversion the fact that an order with a
certain product was completed. You can now use a different order status
(`on-hold`, `pending`, `processing`, and so on). Default is `completed`. Note
this is a temporary workaround until the WooCommerce Product Conversion Action
offers a status selector.
* Updates some labels and adds a few Spanish translations that were missing.


= 4.2.8 (September 14, 2015) =
* **Bug fix**. Some characters were auto-escaped when naming duplicated
experiments or writing alternative CSS fragments. This has now been fixed.


= 4.2.7 (September 8, 2015) =
* **Improvement**. New filter for excluding certain visitors from the running
experiments has been added. The filter is called `nelioab_visitor_in_test`. It
takes one boolean parameter and returns one boolean value: whether the current
visitor is (or is not) in a test.
* **Bug fix**. `console.log` fails on IE9. This has now been fixed.


= 4.2.6 (September 1, 2015) =
* **Bug fix**. Canonical meta tag shows the appropriate value on static front
pages. In the previous version, a `nabe` GET parameter was added (which is
not correct).


= 4.2.5 (August 14, 2015) =
* **Tested with WordPress 4.3**. This version has been tested with WordPress
4.3 and works smoothly.
* **Bug fix**. Alternative pages and posts are no longer shown to non-admin
users (like, for instance, Editors).


= 4.2.4 (August 5, 2015) =
* **Improved support for WPML**. Now, language switcher works for alternative
content.
* **Improved Navigation**. When browsing from one page to the other, A/B
Testing parameters are now added at the server. This way, we reduce the amount
of JavaScript redirections and things go faster and smoother.
* **Bug fix**. Highcharts JS is only included in Nelio's Dashboard and Progress
of the Experiment pages (that is, where it's required).


= 4.2.3 (July 22, 2015) =
* **Bug fix**. Experiments whose tested page/post is a draft cannot be started
until the page/post is published.
* **Bug fix**. The excerpts of some headline experiments were not properly
escaped and, as a result, the progress of the experiment page did not work
properly. This has now been fixed.
* Minor fixes. We fixed a few more issues, such as the quota visualization in
the dashboard page.


= 4.2.2 (June 29, 2015) =
* **Bug fix**. Removed unnecessary JavaScript alert.


= 4.2.1 (June 23, 2015) =
* **Bug fix**. JavaScript error when WooCommerce is not installed (a variable
named `NelioABParams.sync.productSummaries` was undefined and triggered the
error).
* **Issue resolved**. Some servers return a "414 Request-URI Too Long" status
code when adding a too long `utm_referrer` GET parameter. Now the parameter is
only included before syncing to Google Analytics (which is the one who needs
it).
* **Improvement**. In the results page, we now only call a "Winner!" when the
confidence is high enough; otherwise, we call a "Possible Winner"


= 4.2.0 (June 22, 2015) =
* **Support for WooCommerce**. We're very proud to announce that Nelio A/B
Testing is now compatible with WooCommerce. In particular, you can **test
alternative names, featured images, and descriptions for your products**.
Moreover, we included a **new conversion action: monitor when purchases are
completed and make sure that a certain product has been purchased!**
* **Results Page Redesigned**. We've completely redesigned our results page.
Now, the results page is organized into three different sections: (a) _General_
information about your experiment and its progress, (b) details about your
_Alternatives_, with all the relevant actions available (preview, edit,
apply...), and (c) a list of _Conversion Actions_ beautifully presented.
* **More Visual**. We've added new icons in the Creation/Edition user
interface. From now on, conversion actions are easier to identify and insert.
* **Conversion Action Sorting**. You can now sort your conversion actions
easily just by drag-and-dropping them.


= 4.1.5 (June 10, 2015) =
* Bug Fix: Facebook Likes work properly.
* Improvement: Facebook Like dialog now shows all the information (no
cropping).


= 4.1.4 (June 9, 2015) =
* During the Free Trial, the Basic Information action now shows a dialog that
reminds users to validate their e-mail addresses.
* Improved visualization of Free Trial actions on mobile (CSS fix).
* Improved management of Free Trial.


= 4.1.3 (June 8, 2015) =
* **New Free Trial Process!** You no longer need to subscribe to any of our
plans for trying Nelio A/B Testing out. Simply download the plugin, select
_Free Trial_, and see how Nelio works!
* New quota bar in the Dashboard. It now shows the available quota (instead of
the remaining quota).
* **Improvement** Added bot detection in our tracking scripts, to exclude them
from the analysis and results of your A/B tests.
* **Improvement** Refactored some functions in our tracking script, so that one
can easily override click and external page events.
* **Minor Fixes** Some notices and bug fixes have been resolved in this
version.


= 4.1.2 (May 15, 2015) =
* **Improvement** When creating a theme experiment, themes are now ordered
alphabetically.
* **Improvement** We've tweaked the script that tracks click events. Now,
it's able to detect nested elements more accurately.
* **Bug Fix** Alternative loading did not work on some themes that triggered
a `WP_Query` request before the main query. This is now fixed.
* **Bug Fix** Hash anchor URLs working properly during alternative loading.
* **Bug Fix** Icons and colors in Dashboard for Custom Post Type experiments.


= 4.1.1 (May 8, 2015) =
* **New Feature** Experiment Duplication is available to all plans. Don't waste
any more time creating experiments from scratch!
* **Improvement** Now all dates are properly localized to your own timezone.
* **Bug Fix** Alternative Widgets are properly loaded on a theme experiment.


= 4.1.0 (May 5, 2015) =
* **New Feature** Support for Custom Post Types. Use it with any plugin that
defines its own types: videos, articles, products, and so on!
* **Improvement** Improved support for iframes. Nelio A/B Testing will no
longer load alternative content (or track conversions) for nested, duplicated
iframes.
* **Improvement** User interface has been slightly redesigned. Now, it's more
intuitive and more beautiful than ever!
* Several additional improvements and some other bug fixes.


= 4.0.7 (Apr 22, 2015) =
* Plugin compatible with version 4.2.
* Security fix (see [Fixing `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query\_arg()`
usage](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/))


= 4.0.5 (Apr 14, 2015) =
* "Undefined constant" in one of our controllers fixed.


= 4.0.4 (Apr 10, 2015) =
* Improvement: maintain external referrers, so that Google Analytics' reports
include appropriate sources. This uses Google Analytics' `utm_referrer` GET
parameter.
* Improved support for Google Analytics by Yoast. Now, Google Analytics
tracking scripts are added after Nelio's, so that the results tracked by both
tools are more accurate.
* Bug fix on certain installations, in which alternative headlines are not
properly tracked.


= 4.0.3 (Apr 3, 2015) =
* Improvement: tracking external pages when the user leaves the current page
clicking on a `map` » `area` element. Before this update, it only tracked
conversions triggered by the user clicking on an `a` tag or submitting a
form.
* Bug fix with old Nelio tracking cookies.
* Bug fix with direct page/post conversion actions.


= 4.0.1 (Apr 1, 2015) =
* Bug fix tracking visitors on older versions of Internet Explorer. In
particular, accessing the object <code>window.history</code> is now nested
in a <code>try-catch</code> block to prevent things from breaking.


= 4.0.0 (Mar 30, 2015) =
* **Efficiency Improvements**. We've redesigned several components of our
plugin from scratch. Now it's faster and more reliable! We've solved most of
the compatibility issues our plugin had with some JavaScript libraries and
Frameworks (such as, for instance, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or
Angular.js).
* **New Settings Screen**. This new version gets rid of some legacy settings
and introduces some new ones. We've also included a small help icon for each
setting, so that you can easily know what they do.
* **Deprecated**. The function we introduced in version 3.4.4 (NelioAB.delay)
has been deprecated. Make sure you no longer use it!


= 3.4.4 =
* Dashboard redesign. Quick access to your quota!
* Test your Landing Page easily! You now have a specific experiment type for
testing your Front Page.
* Support for the plugin [WP Google Analytics
Events](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-analytics-events/)
* Added new JS function <code>NelioAB.delay</code>. With this function, one can
delay the execution of some JavaScript code (surrounding that code
with <code>NelioAB.delay( function(){</code> and <code>}</code>. This prevents
JavaScript code from being executed twice (one for the original content and
another one for the alternative's).


= 3.4.3 =
* Bug fix while tracking page/post conversion actions.


= 3.4.2 =
* A Fatal Error during Heatmap visualization has been fixed.


= 3.4.1 =
* Removed some DEBUG info from source code.

integrate Menu Testing. Create alternative menus and submenus and discover
which one takes the visitor to the pages you want them to see.
* **New Feature - Experiment Duplication** Don't create experiments from
scratch, but duplicate current experiment definitions. Don't waste your time
defining the same conversion actions over and over again and focus on your
content!
* New Conversion Action. You can now track the "click event" on any element
in your site.
* Several additional improvements.


= 3.3.8 =
* New Setting for **Professional and Enterprise Plans**. You can now monitor
the efficiency of your Headlines from either the front page of your site, or
from any page.
* Removed JavaScript TypeError.


= 3.3.7 =
* Bug fix with widget experiments (alternatives properly tracked).


= 3.3.6 =
* Bug fix with form submission tracking code.
* Bug fix with older versions of IE, where trailing commas in JavaScript fails
throw an exception.


= 3.3.5 =
* Bug fix with quota computation.
* Small improvements.


= 3.3.4 =
* Bug fix. CSS experiments now load alternatives properly (both during
experiment execution and preview).
* Bug fix. When creating Heatmap experiments, the _Create_ button is disabled
only when required.


= 3.3.3 =
* POST-loaded pages are no longer A/B-tested. Otherwise, we may compromise
the POST data.
* Bug fix. Some original pages where marked as alternatives, which means that
they are not available when the plugin is deactivated nor for creating new
experiments. We fixed this.


= 3.3.2 =
* Improved Performance. Several AJAX requests are no longer directed to your
own WordPress server, but to our backend servers. This way, we reduce your
server's load and boost the overall performance.


= 3.3.1 =
* Performance MU-Plugin does no longer deactivate WPML. This way, WPML pages
can be tested (i.e. alternatives are properly loaded).
* We reduced the amount of calls required to sync headline-related tracking
information.
* Bug fix: latest update broke alternative loading for the landing page. This
is now fixed.
* Bug fix: when viewing the progress of an experiment, we now say there's a
winner if (a) the original version is the best or (b) there's an alternative
that's better than the original (even though it's "as good" as other
alternatives).
* We added a small warning when the plugin is updated reminding users to clean
their caches.


= 3.3.0 =
* **New Feature - Widget Testing** Nelio A/B Testing is the first tool to
integrate Widget Testing. Rearrange your current widgets and/or add/remove
widgets and test the changes easily!
* **New Feature - Headline Testing** If you're a publisher or an avid blogger,
you know the importance your posts have. We redefined Title Tests from scratch,
so you can now test new titles, featured images, and excerpts as a whole!
* **New Feature - Create Experiments for Drafts** Create experiments for all
your pages and posts, even if they have not been published yet.
* **Improvement - Consistent Experience** When creating A/B tests, you can make
sure that the proper titles, excerpts or featured images are properly used all
over your site. Don't focus only on the tested page, but everywhere.
* **Improvement - Cache Support Improvements** This version includes
experimental support for caching alternative content. Instead of simply
bypassing cache mechanisms, you can now take full benefit from them.
* **Improvement - Experiment Creation Shortcuts** When browsing your site,
you'll see that the top bar includes quick action links to experiment creation.
* And several additional improvements and bug fixes.


= 3.2.10 =

404 page not found error.

experiments are automatically stopped and, if you want to, the address that's
to be notified (Enterprise users only).
* Improved experiment list page. See the date that is most relevant to an
experiment depending on its state (e.g. creation date for _Draft_ and _Ready_
experiments, start date for _Running_ experiments, or end date _finished
experiments_).

experiments, (a) include all finished experiments, (b) include only those that

having a winner based on the comparison between the best alternative and the
original (not two alternatives).

before they leave with unsaved changes.

upgraded.
* Several improvements and bug fixes.

defined is now preserved.

where not properly selected, and so on. It should be fixed, now.

extended to form submission (assuming that form's action attribute is the same
as the external goal's URL).
* Quick fix. In the progress of the experiment page, goals created with
previous version of the plugin have useful names (instead of "Undefined").
