<h3 id="how-far-in-advance-of-my-rental-date-s-shoul">How far in advance of my rental date(s) should I order the equipment?</h3>
We recommend you place your order as soon as you know what equipment you'll require. However, we do offer both next day and same day service for your last-minute needs.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="can-meeting-tomorrow-provide-same-day-service">Can Meeting Tomorrow provide same day service?</h3>
Yes! Even though our name is Meeting Tomorrow we're happy to help you with your same-day, last-minute needs.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="how-will-i-receive-my-equipment-">How will I receive my equipment?</h3>
If you don't require a technician, your equipment will be delivered to you via courier or express delivery service, directly to your office, home, or meeting location. Meeting Tomorrow does not have staffed retail locations for customers to pick up or drop off equipment.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="why-are-you-delivering-my-equipment-the-day-p">Why are you delivering my equipment the day prior to my rental date? Will I be charged for this extra day?</h3>
With most orders we deliver your equipment the day prior to your rental date for no additional charge. This allows you the opportunity to set up for your event or practice your presentation.

<h3 id="how-do-i-return-my-rental-equipment-back-to-m">How do I return my rental equipment back to Meeting Tomorrow?</h3>
We include pre-paid adhesive FedEx return labels along with our projectors and laptops. After using your equipment, simply affix this label to the outside of the small shipping briefcase container and drop it in any FedEx drop box for return. Bulkier equipment, such as screens or sound systems, will be picked up after your event. In some cases you may need to schedule a FedEx pickup for the equipment, and directions will be provided for you at the time of placing your order.

<h3 id="what-if-i-have-trouble-with-my-equipment-or-i">What if I have trouble with my equipment or it doesn't work?</h3>
All equipment is tested before we deliver it to you. However, if you do have an equipment problem, you can reach a Meeting Tomorrow technician for help by calling 1-877-633-8866. If we cannot fix the problem, we will replace your rental equipment by the quickest means possible - even if that means renting equipment from another company.

<h3 id="how-do-i-know-what-type-of-equipment-is-right">How do I know what type of equipment is right for my needs?</h3>
You can read a short description about each piece of equipment on our website. However, our customer service associates and technicians have the experience and training to help match your requirements with the right equipment. Just give us a call at 1-877-633-8866, send an email to info@meetingtomorrow.com, or use our Live Chat feature.

<h3 id="how-can-i-change-or-cancel-a-previously-place">How can I change or cancel a previously placed order? Will I be charged for a cancellation?</h3>
Please give us a call at 1-877-633-8866 to change or cancel an order. You may cancel your order by providing written notice at least three business days prior to the beginning of your rental period and receive either a refund or a credit towards a future order less 25% nonrefundable cancellation fee.
Examples:
To be eligible for a refund less a 25% cancellation fee, an order placed for a rental period
<ul>
	<li>Beginning on a Friday must be cancelled by the preceding Monday.</li>
	<li>Beginning on a Monday must be cancelled by the preceding Tuesday.</li>
	<li>Beginning on Saturday or Sunday must be cancelled by the preceding Tuesday.</li>
</ul>
If you cancel your order three days or less prior to the beginning of your rental period, you will not receive a refund but will still be eligible for a credit towards a future order. Any cancellations made the same day as the rental date or after delivery has been made will not be eligible for a credit or refund. This includes cancellations for orders placed the same day as your rental date. Any cancellation made the same day as the rental date or after delivery has been made will be treated as a completed lease transaction, with the full lease and other fees provided in these terms and conditions assessed against you.

<h3 id="how-do-i-choose-which-projector-is-right-for-">How do I choose which projector is right for me?</h3>
OurÂ <a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/projector-rentals" target="_blank">projector rentals page</a>Â offers short descriptions and basic uses for each projector; however, we know this does not answer every question. If you'd like to know more, simply tell us what you plan to use the projector for and we'll be happy to suggest the equipment that will work best for your individual situation. Feel free to reach us through live chat or by phone at 1-877-633-8866.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-an-svga-and-xg">What is the difference between an SVGA and XGA projector?</h3>
The image display from an SVGA resolution projector has less pixels, and hence a lower resolution than XGA resolution projectors. This means that XGA projectors produce a clearer, sharper image. SVGA resolution projectors are appropriate for PowerPoint presentations displaying mostly text and presentations in small rooms with dimmed lights. XGA resolution projectors are appropriate for PowerPoint presentations with graphics, and displaying photos or video.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-dlp-and-lcd-pr">What is the difference between DLP and LCD projectors?</h3>
DLP and LCD are two competing technologies used in digital projectors. Until recently, most digital projectors used LCD technology. Over the last few years many manufacturers have switched to using DLP technology. We carry both types of projectors and don't think there's a distinguishable difference.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-are-other-names-for-digital-projectors-">What are other names for digital projectors?</h3>
Digital projectors are also commonly known as LCD projectors, DLP projectors, data projectors, multimedia projectors, computer projectors, video projectors, DVD projectors, InFocus projectors, or Proxima projectors.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-are-lumens-">What are lumens?</h3>
Lumens are the measure of a projector's brightness. Our lowest lumens projector, 1200 lumens, is appropriate for use with a small audience in a room where the lights are dimmed. For larger audiences and brighter venues, we offer projectors ranging all the way up to 25,000 lumens. We would be happy to help you decide what is appropriate for your situation - just give us a call at 1-877-633-8866.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-can-i-connect-to-the-projector-">What can I connect to the projector?</h3>
You can connect any of our projectors to a laptop or desktop computer (PC or Mac), DVD player, VCR, video camera or document camera. Just tell us what you need to connect the projector to, and we'll make sure to include everything you need.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-is-the-contrast-ratio-">What is the contrast ratio?</h3>
The contrast ratio measures how a projector displays the lightest and darkest parts of an image. Projectors with a high contrast ratio (1500:1 or higher) are very good for showing pictures, video, or any presentation with lots of color.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="how-far-should-my-projector-be-from-the-screen-">How far should my projector be from the screen?</h3>
In general your projector should be about twice as far from the screen as your screen is wide. For example, if your screen is 5 feet wide, your projector should be approximately 10 feet from the screen.

The technical term for describing this calculation isÂ <strong>Throw Ratio</strong>. Unless specified otherwise, all of our projectors have a throw ratio of approximately 2:1. This means that for every foot of screen width, your projector should be twice as far away (for a 6-foot wide screen the projector is 12 feet away; for an 8-foot wide screen the projector is 16 feet away; and so on).
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-type-of-audio-equipment-do-i-need-for-a-">What type of audio equipment do I need for a small presentation?</h3>
If you are looking to amplify one person's voice to a small group, you will need a microphone and either a single or pair of powered speakers. If you have more than one microphone you will also need a mixer. A 4 input mixer will handle up to 4 microphones or other audio inputs (CD player, laptop, DVD player, etc.). We also carry 8 and 12 input mixers.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-handheld-and-la">Whatâ€™s the difference between handheld and lavalier microphones?</h3>
Handheld microphones are made to be held in your hand or placed in a microphone stand. Lavaliere microphones are smaller and can be clipped to your jacket or shirt.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-wireless-and-wi">Whatâ€™s the difference between wireless and wired microphones?</h3>
A wireless microphone has no wires connecting it to the other sound equipment, allowing for more freedom of movement. Both the handheld and lavaliere wireless microphones include a transmitter that is usually clipped to your belt, and a receiver that is plugged into the powered speaker or mixer. A wired microphone plugs directly into the mixer or speakers.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="do-i-need-a-mixer-">Do I need a mixer?</h3>
A mixer allows you to control the sound levels of different audio inputs. If you need to amplify the sound from more than one source then you need a mixer. A mixer also is required if you must connect a device that uses RCA audio cables (DVD player, VCR, CD player) or one that uses 1/8 inch audio cables (laptops, iPods).
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-add-on-options-do-i-need-">What add-on options do I need?</h3>
If you will need Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel or Word, you will need to add Microsoft Office. If you need high speed Internet access, you should choose the wired network card or wireless connectivity option.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-is-mini-dv-technology-">What is Mini DV technology?</h3>
Mini DV is an affordable digital video format that is widely used for both private and commercial purposes. This format is currently the most popular for new camcorders being sold today.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-mini-dv-over-dvd-c">What are the advantages of Mini DV over DVD cameras?</h3>
While DVD is common in homes and offices, it has only recently been used to record live video. There are no professional DVD cameras in production, and the consumer-grade models available have limited features and capacity (30 minutes per disc). There is also a much greater risk of the DVD failing than of a Mini DV tape.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="can-i-record-the-mini-dv-tape-on-to-my-vhs-ta">Can I record the Mini DV tape on to my VHS tape, computer, or DVD?</h3>
Yes. You can connect the camcorder to your VCR / stand alone DVD burner/player with the included video cable. This is the easiest way to make copies of a Mini DV tape so everyone is able to watch it since not everyone has a Mini DV camcorder. If you wish to copy your DV tape on to your computer, your computer must have a DVD burner, firewire port, 6 pin to 4 pin firewire cable, and video capturing software. Meeting Tomorrow does not rent or provide support for this equipment.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="how-long-does-the-battery-last-">How long does the battery last?</h3>
Generally, the standard battery it comes with will last approximately 60 minutes (45 minutes while using the LCD screen). You also may use the included A/C adapter for additional power.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="how-long-can-i-record-for-on-a-tape-">How long can I record for on a tape?</h3>
Most tapes can record 60 minutes of footage in SP mode (Standard Play). They are capable of recording longer than 60, but video quality will be sacrificed in the process.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="will-the-mini-dv-tape-work-in-my-older-camcor">Will the Mini DV tape work in my older camcorder?</h3>
The Mini DV tape will only function in a Mini DV camcorder or deck. This tape format is unique to these decks - in much the same way a VHS cassette will not work in a DVD player.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="is-this-camcorder-pal-compatible-">Is this camcorder PAL compatible?</h3>
No. Our camcorders are NTSC, which is the standard in North America, Japan, Canada and many other regions. It is rare to obtain a PAL camcorder unless you are located in a PAL country.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="will-the-camcorder-fit-on-my-tripod-">Will the camcorder fit on my tripod?</h3>
In most cases, it will. The camcorders have a standard 1/4-20 thread, which many consumer grade tripods (for both still and video cameras) use. We also rent tripods that are compatible with all our video cameras.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-a-tripod-and-fa">Whatâ€™s the difference between a tripod and fastfold screen?</h3>
We have three sizes of tripod screens: 5' x 5', 6' x 6' and 8' x 8'. These have a pull down screen and a tripod stand. They are simple to assemble. We also have three larger sizes of fastfold screens: 7.5' x 10', 9' x 12', 10' x 14.5'. These are called "fastfold screens" because of the way the screen is assembled. The actual screen is buttoned to the outside of the frame, which has L shaped legs on each side of it.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="what-size-screen-do-i-need-">What size screen do I need?</h3>
We recommend our smaller 5' and 6' screens for audiences under 100 people. For events up to 300 people, an 8' screen is usually appropriate. For larger events, please consult with one of our friendly customer service representatives for assistance.
<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/faqs#content">Back to top</a>
<h3 id="do-you-offer-technician-services-for-setting-">Do you offer technician services for setting up or running the equipment?</h3>
Yes. The hourly rate for our technicians is $75.

Yes, we always have a technician on-call for after-hours emergencies. You can reach the technician by calling us at 1-877-633-8866 and dialing 6.
