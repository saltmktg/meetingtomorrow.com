<h1>Women's Opportunities in Technology</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]Although the rights of many groups are not secured, women in particular have made great strides forward in the last 100 years. Suffragettes crusaded for a woman's right to vote and succeeded in the 1920s at a time when a significant number of men and women did not approve of a woman placing a vote separate from that of her husband. The employment options available to women exploded during World War II and, though they constricted again following the end of the war, each new decade has brought progress toward equality for women.
<blockquote>As more women attempt to juggle families and careers, technology helps to ease their schedules and offers new opportunities.</blockquote>
As separate feminist movements chose their battles and fought for freedoms, sometimes there has been backlash against women who choose a more traditional life as housewives or stay-at-home moms. For those who believe the end goal of feminism is for women to have the total freedom to decide their own paths, women making informed choices to fill traditional roles are cause for celebration. And now, with the advent of the personal <a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/laptop-computer-rentals">computers</a> and internet connectivity, stay-at-home moms are able to share their views and ideals freely through emails, blogs, and interactive websites.

With online degrees, education is available to moms who are unable to go to school because of time constraints. There are quite a number of online schools that offer programs or degrees that moms can take without compromising their chosen responsibilities as homemakers. Additionally, e-commerce allows moms to take an active part in many types of businesses without leaving home. With an internet connection and a <a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/laptop-rental">laptop</a>, a stay-at-home mom with a knack for business can put up an online store selling products or services to certain market segments. This way, they can earn money while attending to the needs of their families.
