<h1>Better webcasting for continuing medical education.</h1>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
A medical communications company helps pharmaceutical companies educate their audiences throughout the United States through live events with a webcast to remote locations. They needed a preferred audiovisual provider to bring in for backup when working with in-house audiovisual companies.
<h3><strong>Their results</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>100% success rate for their 130 meetings.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Nationwide Continuing Medical Education webcasts to all their locations.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>1,500+ doctors educated on new pharmaceutical rules and guidelines.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What they needed</strong></h3>
They needed a responsive audiovisual provider that could help with last minute equipment requests. They also needed on-site technical support during their remote events and a solid webcasting platform to stream to these locations.
<h3><strong>What we delivered</strong></h3>
Technical site surveys were performed at their remote locations before their events to test internet stability. The survey included a full report on the technical capabilities of each venue with contingency plans for technical issues that could arise. On the day of their event they had trained technicians on-site operating all equipment related to producing, encoding, streaming and downloading their webcast feeds.
