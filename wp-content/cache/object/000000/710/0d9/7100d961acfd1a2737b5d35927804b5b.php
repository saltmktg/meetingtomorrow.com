Fortunately, savvyÂ event planners have a <strong>secret weapon</strong> at their disposal, <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/ipad-rentals" target="_blank">iPad rentals</a>! Below are 10 ways to implement iPad rentals at trade shows, conferences, and meetings.
<h2><strong>1. CompleteÂ Event Registrations &amp; Check-Ins Faster</strong></h2>
There are severalÂ great ways to execute a paperless check-in utilizing iPads. EventÂ staff can easily utilize one of manyÂ <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/blog/5-more-mobile-apps" target="_blank">event registration apps</a> to have guests quickly sign in on iPads. Another more hands-off approach would be to load a custom registrationÂ app on iPad kiosks or <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/ipad-desk-stand-rental" target="_blank">iPad desk stands</a>.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>2. DesignÂ Custom Kiosks</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/ipad-kiosk-rentals" target="_blank">iPad kiosks</a> turn iPads into eye-catching userÂ stations that are perfect for capturing attendee information and displaying content in key areas of your event. Registration, surveys, games and brochures are just a few of the ways to putÂ theseÂ <strong>promotional marketing machines</strong> to good use.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Set up a Point of Sale (POS) System</strong></h2>
<a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/ipad-pos-system-rentals" target="_blank">iPad Point of Sale</a> systems allow you toÂ add inventory via touchscreen or scanner to a Square account and then use aÂ magnetic card reader to accept credit card payments.Â Receipts can be emailed or printed from the receipt printer. Those who only require a simple setup can use a Square or Paypal card reader that fits into the audio jack of any iPad.

<h2><strong>4.Â Make a Big Impression with a Giant iTab</strong></h2>
Looking for an effective way to showcaseÂ your iOS app? The <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/giant-iphone-ipad-rentals">Giant iTab</a> is aÂ <strong>42â€³ touchscreen</strong>Â that looks and acts exactly like a giant iPad or iPhone.Â The perfect tool forÂ app demonstrations, trainings, lead capture, games, social media, wayfinding, and much more.

<h2><strong>5. Create an iPad Video Wall</strong></h2>
Compared to a standard video wall, the <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/ipad-video-wall-rentals">iPad wall</a> is more versatile, cost-effective, easier to transport and allows for <strong>more creative content opportunities</strong>. You can run the same video across any number of iPads or show specific videos on individual iPads.

<h2><strong>6. Run Presentations</strong></h2>
Many people aren't awareÂ theyÂ can control presentation slides directly from an iPad.Â In fact, a speaker with an iPad usingÂ <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204378" target="_blank">Keynote Remote</a> orÂ <a href="https://prezi.com/support/article/ios/controlling-your-presentation-with-your-iphone-ipad/" target="_blank">Prezi</a>Â can trigger actions on a large displayÂ and even on the audience's mobile devices. This makes for a unique viewer experience and gives the presenter total control over their content. They can even view their notes while presenting within the app.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>7. Go Paperless</strong></h2>
Go green with aÂ <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/case-studies/case-study-04">paperless event</a> and engage attendees by providing brochures, maps, and other event materials digitally on iPads. Additional apps can be loaded to <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/case-studies/case-study-05">enable attendees</a> to take notes, share feedback, access meeting agendas, and post to social networks.

<h2><strong>8. Capture MomentsÂ with aÂ Video &amp;Â Photo Booth</strong></h2>
