When you register or re-register at this Site, we may ask you to supply us with Personally Identifiable Information and other information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts. For similar reasons, we may supplement the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with publicly available information about you. We use this information to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. We also use your e-mail address to send you newsletters, as well as messages about Meeting Tomorrow special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. Occasionally, we may send these materials to you via postal mail, using the shipping address provided. Our packages that contain the rental equipment shipped to you may also contain promotional items or advertisements. If you no longer want to receive the newsletters, other announcements or non-equipment-package postal mail, simply send a quick e-mail to info@meetingtomorrow.com with the subject line, "Unsubscribe." Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions.

We track your interactions with us, including but not limited to your Site activity, rental selections, payment history and correspondence, as well as any incoming e-mails and related activity.

Other than as described above, with your consent, we may also share Personally Identifiable Information about you with third parties. Once we share Personally Identifiable Information with your consent to a third party, the use and protection of that information by the third party will no longer be subject to this Privacy Policy.
