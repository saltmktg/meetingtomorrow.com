<h1>AV Basics: Mixers and Amplifiers</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]Having a sound knowledge of <a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/sound-system-rental">mixers</a> and amplifiers can really make a difference in your audio/visual (A/V) experience. An optimized audio/visual environment can be rendered by using acoustic tools such as mixers and amplifiers, as these will ensure that all your visuals and sounds are coherent and make your A/V experience more enjoyable.

Built-in speakers will suffice when the A/V presentation is made to a small group of people. However, for a larger audience that is seated in a comparatively big conference room, it is necessary to use amplifiers. Then again, you may encounter a situation where you need to make your audio track more flexible. Sometimes during an A/V session, different sound sources need to be combined with the video source. Since a variety of audio sources are involved in this process, using mixers is the best way to combine the audio and video seamlessly.

An <strong>amplifier</strong>, or amp, is a device that modulates the amplitude of a sound signal. Generally, the signal is a current or voltage. The electronic amplifiers that are available in the market today are effective in increasing the sound signal, so that the audio can reach the far corners of a large room, which most small speakers cannot do.

There are two important components of an amplifier, and they are the <strong>transfer function</strong> and the <strong>gain</strong> of the amplifier. The transfer function determines the relationship of the input to the output of the amplifier, and the magnitude of the transfer function is called the gain.

A <strong>mixer</strong> is an electronic device which is often used for changing the quality and the levels of audio signals. It is also known as a mixing console, an audio mixer, or a soundboard. Using a mixer is the most convenient way to route or combine various audio signals and even change the timbre and dynamics of the sound. The high-end mixers that are available today can effortlessly mix analog and digital signals, making your audio integrate with the video to give a perfectly consistent and coherent A/V experience.

The usage of mixers and amplifiers is not only restricted to conference rooms and A/V presentations. They are used in a variety of applications and environments as well, which can range from recording studios, sound reinforcement systems, and public address systems to television, broadcasting, and film post-production. For example, amplifiers and mixers come into play when sound from two separate microphones is channeled to a single set of speakers simultaneously. This is the typical scenario during live concerts when two vocalists are singing together. Also, the signal produced by the mixer is sent directly to the amplifier. In this manner, the sound output increases exponentially and it enables the audience to immerse themselves in the music.

There is a wide variety of mixers and amplifiers available in the market to suit different A/V needs. It is important that you know exactly what kind of A/V experience you want to create before you decide which mixer or amplifier you need.
