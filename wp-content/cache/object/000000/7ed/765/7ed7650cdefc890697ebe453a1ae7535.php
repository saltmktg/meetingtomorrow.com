<h2>Data-Enabled &amp;Â WiFi-Only iPads Available</h2>
Choose from either data-enabled or WiFi-only Internet access iPads for both generations.

Not sure which you need? Data-enabled models (3G and 4G available) are a good choiceÂ whenÂ the iPads will be used in areas withoutÂ reliable WiFi access.

When aÂ stable wireless network is available, WiFi-only iPads help users avoid incurring additional chargesÂ forÂ data contracts and overages. WiFi-only models canÂ work wellÂ when content is being downloaded onto iPads to be read later. WiFi-only iPads may be a good choice for use at schools/universities, offices, museums,Â conferences, and other institutions with wireless networks.
<h2 id="specs">Additional Specifications</h2>
<strong>Screen:</strong> Both models feature aÂ 9.7-inch screen, though Apple enhancedÂ the sharpness and clarity of the screen on theÂ iPad 3 by adding "retina" display.

<strong>Battery Life:</strong> The estimated battery life for both models is 9-10 hours.

<strong>Camera:</strong> The iPad 2's camera is only .7 megapixels, but the iPad 3's camera is a significant upgrade at 5 megapixels.

<strong>Weight:</strong> The iPad 2 weighs slightly less (1.33 lbs) compared to the iPad 3 (1.46 lbs).

<strong>Operating System:</strong> All feature iOS 9.
