<h1>Dress For Success</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]If you are new to the job market, there are many important standards to be met before you go on an actual interview. Besides showing up to an interview prepared (make sure to bring a pen, pad of paper, and extra copies of your resume) it's important to dress the part. Dressing for success is the term most commonly referred to. It's appropriately titled; if you want to get the part, you have to dress the part. If you are going to a business interview, appropriate business attire is required.

The business attire differs for both men and women, but there are some common rules that apply to both genders. It is not okay to show up to an interview clad in a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. Facial piercings should be removed. Make sure to cover any visible tattoos. Hair should be tidy, and clothes should fit properly. Most importantly, don't chew gum.

<strong>Women</strong>

Women have a more versatile approach when it comes to business attire. Pants, business suits and an appropriate skirt are acceptable. If you opt for two separate pieces, make sure the tops and bottoms match accordingly. Skirt lengths should reach the top of the knees, and slits should be minimal. Make sure the blouse worn with a business suit, pants or skirt is appropriate - nothing low cut or revealing. All clothing should be a solid and dark color.

Make-up should be kept very low key. Jewelry should be conservative and not overwhelming. Make sure to wear proper hosiery if wearing a skirt. Shoes should be closed-toe and dark colored.

<strong>Men</strong>

Men do not have the diversity women do when it comes to business attire. Either a business suit or matching pant and jacket set are acceptable. A tie is a must. If you do not know how to tie a tie, learn.

As with women, clothing color should be dark, and patterns should be very minimal. Ties should not have a flashy print, or be seasonal. Make sure to wear dark dress socks with dark colored shoes. A belt is preferred, and shirts must be tucked in. Make sure facial hair is groomed accordingly, and if you must wear a watch, make sure it looks professional and conservative.
