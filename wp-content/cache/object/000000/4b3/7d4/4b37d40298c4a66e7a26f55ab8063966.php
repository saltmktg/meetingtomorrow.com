<h1>Streamlining support for 1,200 dinner meetings.</h1>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
A medical communications company helps pharma and medical brands tell the true story behind the products and services they produce and the lives they improve. They spend a large portion of their budget on face-to-face meetings where they deliver presentations on medications and medical devices to small gatherings of individuals at hundreds of locations across the United States.
<h3><strong>Their results</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>1,200+ meetings a year supported nationwide.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A reliable partnership that has lasted over three years.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What they need</strong></h3>
They produce events all across the country so they need a provider that can scale to meet their needs. They need trained technicians who are knowledgeable in compliance rules for the pharmaceutical industry. They need basic presentation equipment - but a lot of it. With over 1,200 meetings a year, they need equipment to be perfectly functional and delivered on time. All the time.
<h3><strong>What we deliver</strong></h3>
We provide easy access to equipment rentals online that their meeting planners can access 24 hours a day. We created packages of their most often requested equipment to help standardize their meetings all across the country.

Our remote management team actively monitors shipping and on-site technician confirmation notices so they never have to wonder where their support is. The team also optimizes processes on an ongoing basis - if something doesnâ€™t work anymore it gets changed within 24 hours with feedback from the client. This helped improve the success rate of the meetings compared to those run by previous providers.
