<h2><strong>1. MakeÂ an Interactive Whiteboard with aÂ Wiimote</strong></h2>
An <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/content-library/interactive-whiteboards">interactive whiteboard</a> displays a computer screen and allows presenters to controlÂ theÂ screen remotely using a special marker or device. Interactive whiteboards are most popular in educational settings, but can be anÂ expensive investment.Â Which is why people were so excited when researcher Johnny Chung Lee discovered a way to make an interactive whiteboard for less than $50 using a projector, a <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/nintendo-wii-gaming-rental">Wiimote</a>, and an infrared LED light.

Watch Lee'sÂ TED Talk below on how to hack a Wiimote to create an interactive whiteboard, or visit <a href="http://www.wiimoteproject.com/" target="_blank">http://www.wiimoteproject.com/</a> for detailed instructions.
<h2><strong>2. Paint a Mural</strong></h2>
Anyone can paint a mural using a projector--no talent or experience are required! Simply create a black and white version of a high-contrast image and project it largely on aÂ wall. Trace over the lines of the projected image using a pencil, then allow guests to fill in the mural together using paint. Complete step-by-step instructions are available <a href="http://www.paintamural.pipalo.com/mural-step-by-step-guide/">here</a>.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="675"]<img src="http://goodsparkgarage.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/4_project.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="450" /> Remember to choose an image that not only reinforces your brand, but also works well for projecting and painting, such as this motorcycle mural by Wilkinson Bros.[/caption]

Shoot a time-lapse video of the mural's creation to share it online and to document how many people took part in the fun.
<h2><strong>3. CoordinateÂ a Musical Laser Light Show</strong></h2>
Replicate eye-catching laser light shows typically seen at rock concerts forÂ your next event using a projector and a free open source software called <a href="http://www.musicbeam.org/">MusicBeam</a>. DownloadÂ this software to create a one-of-a-kind light show for any piece of music.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D9owK6OHUWE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
MusicBeam's creator recommends using a <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/15000-to-25000-lumens-projector-rental">high-lumen projector</a> to achieve the best effect.
<h2><strong>4. Share Event-Related Social Media</strong></h2>
Use a <a href="http://www.ethos3.com/2015/06/6-solutions-for-social-media-displays-at-conferences/">tool</a> to aggregate online comments and photos about the event, then display them in a central location to share them with event-goers. YouÂ may want to include posts that appear on the event's social mediaÂ profiles, posts that use the event's hashtag, and posts that include check-ins at the event's venue.

Show speakers' posts during their sessions and show questions submitted online during the Q&amp;A portion. Assign an administratorÂ to screenÂ the posts for any inappropriate content before they are displayed.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> As of December 2015, Meeting Tomorrow now offers a <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/social-media-wall-rentals">social media wall package</a>.
<h2><strong>5. Create Stealth Illusions with Optical Camouflage</strong></h2>
Optical camouflage, also sometimes called the "invisibility cloak" effect, creates the illusion of invisibility by projecting an image of the background onto a highly-reflective material. The result is the material appears to blend in with the surroundings. Auto and aviation manufacturers have explored using this technology to assist drivers and pilots by allowing them to "look through" walls that otherwise created blind spots.

Event applications may be a little more novelty-based than industry or military ones, but allowing attendees to capture images of themselves "disappearing" will surely have attendees flocking to your booth.

<h2><strong>6. Host a Gaming Lounge</strong></h2>
Enhance gamification events or simply attract attention to your trade boothÂ by inviting attendeesÂ to relax inÂ a free gaming lounge.Â Hang curtains around the event space to provide privacy and block out distractions for guests. DressÂ the space like the ultimateÂ living room oasis--complete with snacks, comfy seats, and video games played on a massive screen.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="676"]<img class="" src="http://sarahandgee.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/img_7624.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="428" /> Ottawa Barcraft and Shopify teamed up to transform this loft space into a private gaming lounge with several distinct gaming zones.[/caption]

Surround sound speakers canÂ add to the illusion that participantsÂ have temporarily left the eventÂ for a gaming break with buddies.Â Share gamers' top scores online or on another screen to encourage competition and social shares! For best results, choose a projector that featuresÂ HD game console inputs, such as our <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/projector-screen-package-rental">standard projector and screen package</a>.
<h2><strong>7. Show Off Your Assets</strong></h2>
Gain attention by projecting eye-catching images in your booth space (ask aboutÂ a short-throw lens for projecting in tight spots). The tone of yourÂ event will likely inform what photos you choose to display, but sources of content could include your catalog/website, demonstration videos orÂ stills, company photos, and new product images.

Relevant footage from a GoPro or drone, or real-time images from a remote camera can be an engaging substitute for professional photographs, as well.
<h2><strong>8. Update Guests with an Information Radiator</strong></h2>
<blockquote>"An Information radiator is a display posted in a place where people can see it as they work or walk by. It shows readers information they care about without having to ask anyone a question. This means more communication with fewer interruptions." --<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Information+radiator">Alistair Cockburn</a></blockquote>
Event plannersÂ can combine anÂ information radiator, a commonly used tool in AgileÂ project management, with projectors to provide guests with updates throughout an event. Easily and unobtrusivelyÂ shareÂ reminders aboutÂ upcoming sessions, agenda changes, event highlights, and local information such asÂ weather forecasts.

Consider displaying metrics thatÂ reflect the success of the event including the daily attendance numbers, number of traditional andÂ social media mentions about the event, number of event app downloads, and even year-over-year comparisons of metrics for annual events.
<h2><strong>9. Create a Seasonal Scene with Projected Reality</strong></h2>
Project an animated Halloween or Christmas-themed scene at your next seasonal corporate event using an <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/lcd-projector-rentals">LED projector</a> and DVD player. This effect is sometimes known as projected reality, digital decorating, or virtual 3D projection because it can give the illusion of 3D projection without the need for viewers to wear 3D glasses.

Projected reality works extremely well for spooky Halloween scenes since theyÂ usually feature translucent or shadowy figures and are intended to be shown in dimly-lit areas. Dozens of DVDs with pre-recorded scenes are available for purchase, and even allow forÂ some customization.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIMHbLr6luw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
Project the scenes directly onto walls and surfaces, or mount a rear-projection screen in a window for outdoor viewing.Â Sync music and sound effects with your animations to provideÂ guests with a truly haunting experience.
