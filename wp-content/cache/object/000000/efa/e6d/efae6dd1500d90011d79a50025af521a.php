While similar in purpose and execution, there are some key differences to note. Read on for a quick breakdown of these two types of web events.
<h2><strong>Webcasts</strong></h2>
A webcast is typically a <strong>one-way flow</strong> of information, broadcast over the internet to a large audience. The audience does not usually contribute much to the content of the webcast, which might include an audio stream, presentation slides, or video clips.

When looking for a <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/webcasting-services" target="_blank">webcasting technology provider</a>, capacity for handling a large number of viewers is essential. Connection support and the ability to work with a variety of computer systems is also very important.

Webcasts can be used to extend the reach of traditional live events to virtual attendees as well. Productions that have both live and virtual components are known as hybrid events.
<h2><strong>Webinars</strong></h2>
A webinar, on the other hand, is an online <strong>interactive</strong> meeting or seminar. The content will likely be educational or training-based. The audience is typically smaller than that of a webcast and often contributes much to the discussion via polling, Q&amp;A, or other collaborative means.

Webinar serviceÂ providers must <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/services/virtual-meetings" target="_blank">overseeÂ all the interactive elements</a> in addition to the basic coordination of the audio/video stream.
