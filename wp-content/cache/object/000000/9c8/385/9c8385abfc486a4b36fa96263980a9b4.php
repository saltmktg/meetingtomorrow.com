The Wall is an ever-evolving, collaborative effort.Â  Thereâ€™s always paper, pens and thumbtacks available nearby so that anyone can add a note recognizing a peer for something specific theyâ€™ve done related to one of our three core values:
<h2><b>Commitment, Kindness, Humility</b></h2>
<h3>What do these words mean?Â  Here are the literal definitions according to Merriam-Websterâ€™s Dictionary.</h3>
<b>Commitment:</b>Â  the attitude of someone who works very hard to do or support something

<b>Kindness:</b>Â  having or showing a gentle nature and a desire to help others; wanting and liking to do good things and to bring happiness to others

<span><b>Humility:</b></span><span>Â  the quality or state of not thinking you are better than other people</span><span></span>
