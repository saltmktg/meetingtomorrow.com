So goes the refrain from our 2012, 90‚Äôs inspired music video, ‚Äú<a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/appreciate-you" target="_blank">Appreciate You</a>.‚Äù The brainchild and in-house production of some very talented folks here at Meeting Tomorrow, this was a fun way for us to¬†share some creative talents with our clients while letting them know how much they mean to us!

Three years later not much has changed. We still try to find new ways to reach out to our clients and¬†provide them not only with flawless execution for every event, but the <strong>appreciation</strong> we have for them¬†and their business.
<h3>Look out for a new re-mix coming in 2016!</h3>

<strong>Appreciate You: Lyrics</strong>

<em>Meeting Tomorrow, nationwide, one time, let‚Äôs go.</em>

<em>It‚Äôs Nikki O on the mic one time,</em>
<em>Rapping sales for you with this dope rhyme.</em>
<em>We be takin‚Äô orders, lickity split</em>
<em>We‚Äôre always here for you, we never quit.</em>
<em>Account Support is round the calls,</em>
<em>They ain‚Äôt distracted by the fish on the walls.</em>
<em>We can take your event to a new dimension,</em>
<em>With flawless execution, not giving you hyper-tension.</em>
<em>We got dogs and trolls, butterflies, and a monkey.</em>
<em>At Meeting Tomorrow, we always keep it funky.</em>
<em>So day or night, give us a call.</em>
<em>No matter your order, big or small.</em>
<em>iPad, projector, plasma or microphone,</em>
<em>From coast to coast we let our presence be known.</em>
<em>So what I‚Äôm trying to say without hesitation,</em>
<em>Is we‚Äôve got you covered throughout the whole nation.</em>

<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>
<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>

<em>So you got a meeting tomorrow, need to ship a projector?</em>
<em>Maybe a microphone, some cables and back-up surge protector?</em>
<em>They‚Äôll be packed up nice and tight by some talented hands -</em>
<em>Nobody messes with the Warehouse Clan!</em>
<em>Order set-up with that? Yeah we‚Äôll take it from here,</em>
<em>Calculate the rate of freight, ready the tech and the gear.</em>
<em>Fill in every last request for your special day or night.</em>
<em>Making sure we get it right from gigabytes to ceiling heights.</em>
<em>Got 80 break-out rooms and need a team of technicians?</em>
<em>Sounds like you could the help of these in-house magicians.</em>
<em>Breaking their backs to make the most of every cent you‚Äôve spent.</em>
<em>This crew of two with follow through for you, Production represent!</em>
<em>Big or small, we‚Äôll do it all to make you look like a pro,</em>
<em>So like this rhyme you‚Äôre event will shine and have the illest flow.</em>
<em>Whatever challenge you got, we‚Äôre gonna build a solution,</em>
<em>Cause nothing‚Äôs sweeter than providing you with flawless execution.</em>

<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>
<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>

<em>It‚Äôs always been ‚Äòbout you and gonna be ‚Äòbout you, the life source,</em>
<em>And we‚Äôre Event Support.</em>
<em>So breathe easy, ah, breathe easy, ah.</em>
<em>We‚Äôve got you covered like Weezie on a winter day,</em>
<em>George‚Äôs wifey feeling great.</em>
<em>Ralphie in his snowsuit, cuddle up we‚Äôll show you,</em>
<em>We blanket in the nation too, cozy like a snuggie suit.</em>
<em>Crankin‚Äô up those stations, running all the satellite feed.</em>
<em>We‚Äôre just trying to serve you, showing we deserve you.</em>
<em>Partnerships that‚Äôs meant to last,</em>
<em>Poker chips that ain‚Äôt our past, won‚Äôt gamble that on your webcast.</em>
<em>Techs out on the front line,</em>
<em>Your dinner meeting‚Äôs on time.</em>
<em>Holding down our homebase you‚Äôd think that they were heaven-sent,</em>
<em>But no man, no yo, that‚Äôs just Project Management.</em>
<em>So don‚Äôt get it twisted, for you we‚Äôre so efficient.</em>
<em>From the start to the finish, we‚Äôre focused like a laser.</em>
<em>From our hearts we‚Äôre committed to be your lifesaber.</em>
<em>Won‚Äôt rely on the force, cause ya‚Äôll are all we need.</em>
<em>Tell us what you want, won‚Äôt stop till you succeed.</em>
<em>We never leave it dark, or leave you all alone.</em>
<em>And I gotta throw it in man, please once, YOLO.</em>

<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>
<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>

<em>With a hey to a ho and ho to a hey,</em>
<em>We‚Äôre delivering a special thank you in a unique way.</em>
<em>I‚Äôm the one they call the prez, aka the boss,</em>
<em>And for all the lovely clients that put the special in our sauce,</em>
<em>We‚Äôre here to show you gratitude without shame.</em>
<em>For all you sucker CEOs, I‚Äôm gonna put some salt in your game.</em>
<em>Full speed ahead like Tebow; running things like D. Rose.</em>
<em>Coast to coast, nationwide, is everywhere that we goes.</em>
<em>Work can be so hectic, the car is electric,</em>
<em>And when it comes to appreciation, Nathan has a metric.</em>
<em>Kelsey‚Äôs the dog, a Labrador, not a doodle.</em>
<em>Nationwide AV, number one rank on the Google.</em>
<em>Finance, IT, HR, Administration,</em>
<em>Cashin checks, writing specs, sustainable foundation is what they do every day.</em>
<em>Showin appreciation.</em>
<em>For all our clients, coast to coast,</em>
<em>Don‚Äôt like to boast, but you‚Äôre the best,</em>
<em>In the north and deep down south, from the east and way out west.</em>
<em>That‚Äôs why we just wanted to say‚Ä¶we appreciate your business each and every day.</em>

<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>
<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>
<em>Thank you for all you do.</em>
<em>We are digging your business and appreciate you.</em>
