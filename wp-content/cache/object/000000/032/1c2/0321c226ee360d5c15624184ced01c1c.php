We have numerous recycling bins in our main office and strongly encourage our employees to limit their waste.

This year there are some changes being made to Chicago's recycling program that affectÂ what can be recycled and the method in which it isÂ done. Most notably, as of Jan. 1st, all recyclables mustÂ be placed in bins WITHOUTÂ a bag. Another change is thatÂ all cartons (including milk, juice, broth, wine, ice cream, and soup cartons) are now recyclable.

To coincide with these changes, <a href="http://www.recyclebycity.com/chicago" target="_blank">Recycle by City Chicago</a> has launched a great new website to help educate everyone here in the windy city. They have a <a href="http://www.recyclebycity.com/chicago/guide" target="_blank">residential guide</a>, <a href="http://www.recyclebycity.com/chicago/tips-and-links" target="_blank">tips &amp; tricks</a> and even a <a href="http://www.recyclebycity.com/chicago/quiz" target="_blank">recycling quiz</a>!

To make sure everyone at MTÂ is buttoned up on these changes, we took the quiz today at our December 2015 staff meeting. We did pretty well but got caught up on recycling greasy/wet paper products and also cartons. You can view our results below.
