<h1>Technology Tips for Teachers</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]In today's classrooms, teachers often use technology to get students interested in different topics. Many teachers are finding benefits in using websites and blogs as teaching tools. In the English and writing fields, for example, students are able to create their own online journals.
<blockquote>Teaching resources like Puzzlemaker have been around for ten years or more. Teachers can also find new resources via their students' internet knowledge.</blockquote>
The first steps to creating an educational website are picking a domain and hosting site. The school board occasionally has its own domain available, though some teachers may need to find their own. If the goal is for students to start their own weblogs, many blogging sites (such as Wordpress, Blogger, or Typepad) offer free accounts with a number of customizable blog templates, with options for password-protected entries to protect students' privacy or allow only the teacher to review a student's writing. <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Livejournal</a>Â offers even more comprehensive privacy options and a fully customizable interface for students who may have web design knowledge.

<a href="http://www.teach-nology.com/tutorials/design_site/" rel="nofollow">Teachology</a> features tips and suggestions on creating websites for the classroom. <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/articles/top991.htm" rel="nofollow">Tips on Creating and Maintaining an Educational Website</a> offers eight simple tips that teachers should follow. Teachers may also find it helpful to add communication tools to their sites: chat rooms, message boards, or other similar ideas. <a href="http://www.thewritingteacher.org/writing-blog-home/2009/1/6/teaching-writing-by-creating-a-website.html" rel="nofollow">The Writing Teacher</a> discusses how students can learn to be better writers by working on their own websites.
