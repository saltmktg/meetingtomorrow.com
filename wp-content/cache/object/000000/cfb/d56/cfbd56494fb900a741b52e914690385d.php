<h1>Educating small business owners everywhere in the United States.</h1>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
An experiential agency raises awareness for their clients by creating compelling experiences at events all across the country. They partnered with one client, a global leading internet and technology company, to produce a traveling series of events educating small business owners on modern web practices.
<h3><strong>Their results</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>90 successful events in 60 cities across the United States over 2 years.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A great relationship with a traveling technical director they can trust.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What they needed</strong></h3>
They needed a consistent, reliable partner that could scale their operations to meet whatever market their client wanted to promote in - even on short notice. They needed access to equipment, services and detail oriented on-site technical support everywhere throughout the United States.
<h3><strong>What we delivered</strong></h3>
We provided full technical event consultation to fully tailor a solution to their design renderings. When the client absolutely loved a technician in one market we made it possible for the same technician to function as a technical director at the remaining events in the series. This kept the events consistent, efficient and it kept their end-client happy.
