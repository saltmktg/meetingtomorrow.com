<h1>How to be in 683 places at once.</h1>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
A major retail clothing company was launching a new premium denim line. As part of the launch event, their marketing agency created a documentary designed to air on a loop, in hundreds of stores across the country, simultaneously.
<h3><strong>Their results</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Impressive new jeans got an equally impressive launch event, clinching the company‚Äôs new position in the premium denim retail market.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What they needed</strong></h3>
They needed equipment delivered, set up and run in 683 locations across the country at the same time. And the budget did not allow for any on-site technicians. They didn‚Äôt have the time to search for local providers in each market so they needed one who could get the job done right in every market.
<h3><strong>What we delivered</strong></h3>
We provided identical 42‚Äù Plasma TVs and special looping DVD players delivered to 683 stores nationwide on the same day. Color-coded cords and a custom how-to video created by Meeting Tomorrow technicians enabled the 683 store managers to easily set up and run the equipment themselves.

Follow up with each store manager confirmed that the setup was done correctly and all systems were go. Meanwhile, Meeting Tomorrow communicated the progress of each location to the client, in real time, through an online dashboard. We worked with the store managers directly, so our client, a brand manager at the store‚Äôs marketing agency, was free to focus on keeping her client happy.
