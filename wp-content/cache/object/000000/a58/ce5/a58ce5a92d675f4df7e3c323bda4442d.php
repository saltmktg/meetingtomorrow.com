This week weâ€™re continuing with 5 more apps weâ€™ve found to consistently perform well for event planners. Read on for recommendations regarding networking, registration, presentations, social media, and surveys.

While choosing the right app requires careful consideration, these suggestions should be enough to get you started. If youâ€™d like to discuss other ideas, <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/contact" target="_blank">give us a call</a> and one of our technology specialists will be happy to talk to you about your event.
<h2><strong>1. Keynote</strong></h2>
<img class=" wp-image-12203 alignnone" src="http://meetingtomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/keynote-icon.png" alt="keynote icon" width="200" height="200" />
One question weâ€™re always being asked is, "What's the best app to use for Powerpoint?" The answer really depends on the presentation content and how itâ€™s going to be used, but weâ€™ve found <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/keynote/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-features-com" target="_blank">Keynote</a>Â works well time and time again.

Beyond standard presentation options, there are advanced control settings like autoplay, looping, and video mirroring. One of our favorites is Keynote Remote, which allows the presenter to use a mobile device to trigger slide changes and transitions on the screen that the audience is viewing.

It should be noted that when converting from Powerpoint to Keynote sometimes certain things like fonts and animations arenâ€™t carried over. It's always best to convert, tweak and test to make sure your presentation looks perfect.
<h2><strong>2. Eventbrite</strong></h2>

<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/eventbriteapp/" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> is an all-in-one networking tool that enables event organizers to simultaneously manage and promote their event.

GuestsÂ can see what events their friends are going to, buy tickets within the app, and present them on their phone. Organizers can check in attendeesÂ within the app and validate tickets using the camera on their mobile devices. Maps, directions, and other supplemental materials can be uploaded for everyone to see and stats can be viewed by the organizer at any time.

The supplemental app <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/l/neon/" target="_blank">Eventbrite Neon</a> also allows users to accept payments using a card reader, process refunds, and produce paper tickets on the spot via wireless printing. If you're looking for an app that will be thereÂ with you every step of the way, Eventbrite is certainly worth a look.
<h2><strong>3. Hootsuite</strong></h2>

Social media is an undeniablyÂ huge part of any conference orÂ trade show,Â andÂ staying on topÂ of all your feedsÂ during the event can be daunting. <a href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> allows you to focus all of your social media accountsÂ through a single app to see what people are saying, easily manage your streams, and schedule posts in advance.

Add employees to your accounts without sharing your passwords and amplify your messages safely using assignable permission levels. You can reply to different posts from a single dashboard and archive common answers to save time.

Key users and important people can be tracked and added to watch lists, and you can measure ROI and utilize analytics to determine the overall success of your campaigns.
<h2><strong>4. Zkipster</strong></h2>

<a href="https://www.zkipster.com/" target="_blank">Zkipster</a> is another great event check-in app that is similar to Check In Easy but provides some other key features.

Guest lists, event flyers, and seating charts can be uploaded and printed along with name tags using a wireless printer. Customer service is available 24/7 and stats can be monitored during and after the event. Multiple devices can be synced and used to check in each guest in under 3 seconds.

The app can be set up to send out arrival alerts via text or email once a VIP arrives and profile pictures can be uploaded and selected to go along with guest names on the list. The app is set up to work offline in case of a connection issue, and new guests can be added easily even after the list is uploaded.
<h2><strong>5. Polldaddy</strong></h2>
<img class=" wp-image-12207 alignnone" src="http://meetingtomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/polldaddy.png" alt="polldaddy" width="326" height="80" />
<a href="https://polldaddy.com/iOS/" target="_blank">Polldaddy</a> is an easy-to-use survey app that allows you to collect data anywhere using mobile devices.

The app can take the place of any paper form and can be used for street surveys, at the office for patient logins, or as an eye-catching way to collect feedback at conferences and events. Offline surveying is possible, and once a connection is made, data is automatically synced to your Polldaddy account.

<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2014/02/20/monkey-mobile-app/" target="_blank">SurveyMonkey</a> is another great survey app that allows you toÂ collect results via email and social media, and monitor them in real time. Surveys can be constructed using the 160 templates that come with the app, or you can build your own from scratch. The app also has analytics as well as other features like kiosk compatibility, page randomization, and skip logic.
