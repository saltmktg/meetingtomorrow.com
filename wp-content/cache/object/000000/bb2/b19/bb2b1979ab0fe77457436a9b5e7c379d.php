<h1>Who Said That? Famous American Speeches</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]There have been many great famous Americans, and those who are best remembered have also given some stirring speeches.

Perhaps one of the best known and well-loved speeches in American history is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech. His speech, given in Washington, DC to millions of people there and through the magic of television, spoke about the equal rights that all Americans share. He also share his dream that everyone would get along regardless of the color of their skin, and that blacks and whites could work together in harmony. This famous speech will live on in the memory of millions of Americans, and serves as an inspiration today.

Ronald Reagan is one of the country's most beloved presidents. He led the conservative movement, and still serves as an icon for the Republicans today. He and his wife Nancy made great contributions to the United States. His keen ability to read into the American public and see what they were seeking in terms of policy changes was uncanny. He spoke on several occasions, including the state of the union, the fortieth anniversary of D-Day, countless Congressional speeches and many others. Some say his speeches were the best of the presidential addresses in recent history, earning him the nickname of "The Great Communicator."

One of America's founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, had some of the most memorable quotes of all time. He was a believer in freedom, liberty, and the truth. He once said, "Question with boldness. Hold to the truth. Speak without fear." Jefferson has inspired countless people to be brave, strive for freedom, and have faith in the principles that have this country great. His presidency had a huge impact on future foreign affairs and dealings with the economy. Without his contribution the United States would not have many of the freedoms it has today.

Out of all of the American presidents, Abraham Lincoln may be the most memorable. Before his untimely assassination in 1865, he was influential in helping to end slavery. He wanted to stop the Civil War from continuing on, and encouraged both sides to embrace freedom. His Emancipation Proclamation and Gettysburg Address are both some of the most famous speeches in all of American history. They have offered up inspiration for a nation, and had great influence on the tone of the nation at that time. The Emancipation Proclamation claimed that all slaves at that time would be free, making Lincoln a key president for our nation's freedom.
