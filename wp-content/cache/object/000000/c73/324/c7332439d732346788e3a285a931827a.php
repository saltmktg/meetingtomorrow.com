<h1>Wireless Microphone Basics</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]<a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/microphones-rental">Wireless microphones</a> use a battery to transmit the radio waves across the frequency to the receiver. This means that a strong battery should be used at all times. When the battery begins to lose steam, the microphone may sound scratchy or distorted, especially during the recording process. Experts recommend replacing the battery after several uses and before problems arise.

To install the wireless microphone, users should turn off the transmitter but turn on the receiver. Most wireless microphones now come with an automatic setting that scans the area and selects the right frequency for use with the system. Once the frequency is found, the user can adjust the volume of the receiver to the appropriate level for the situation and turn on the transmitter. They can then sync the transmitter and receiver and make any adjustments they think is necessary.

Users should consider the different types of wireless microphones available. The <a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/product/wireless-handheld-microphone-rental">handheld microphone</a> with built-in transmitter is best for those who need a microphone which they can move around frequently. There's also a microphone with a transmitter in a pack that attaches to the body. The transmitter is fixed, but the microphone can be moved. <a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/product/wireless-lavalier-microphone-rental">Clip-on lapel microphones</a> contain stronger transmitters that allow them to pick up sounds further away from the microphone, so that a presenter may wear an unobtrusive microphone without having to worry if it will pick up his or her speech.

Some users have experienced problems called dropouts, where the sound dies away. This usually happens when the transmitter and receiver are too close together, and moving one or both objects will usually stop the problem from occurring. Larger objects placed around the microphone can also cause dropouts and problems with distortion, especially when objects are larger than the transmitter. Removing the objects typically solves the problem.

Wireless microphones work by using either UHF or VHF frequencies. UHF usually uses more power, which allows it to have a larger range than VHF models. It also has fewer problems associated with distortion from outside objects. The VHF models typically have a few more problems with distortion and range, but have a longer battery life. They usually last longer than the UHF models as well.
