By working with an outside provider, though, meeting planners can consistently save on costs and expect great service. Here are the top eight reasons to consider using an outside AV provider for your event rental needs.</span>
<h3 class="p1"><b>#1. <b>Because you can!</b></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The in-house supplier is not the only option. Some venues make commission when booking audio visual services through a contracted provider, and thatâ€™s why those facilities recommend certain providers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A venue cannot prevent you from bringing in your own rental company, however, and negotiating any restrictive clauses out of the contract is easy to do (learn how to do so </span><a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/hotel-audio-visual-companies-byo-hotel-av" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Regardless of which provider you choose, itâ€™s a good idea to bring outside quotes into your negotiations to potentially drive down in-house costs.</span>

<h3 class="p1"><b>#2. <b>Latest equipment &amp; technology are available</b></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside AV rental providers constantly purchase new equipment and phase out older or worn-out products. Youâ€™re much more likely to get the best equipment (like the <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/ipad-air-2-rental" target="_blank">iPad Air 2</a>, <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/iphone-rentals" target="_blank">iPhone 6</a>, and <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/4k-touch-screen-rental" target="_blank">4K touch screens</a>)Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you work with a nationwide partner. Even if you donâ€™t need the newest projector or laptop, an outside AV company will have a number of options so you can choose the exact model that fits your needs.</span><a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/touch-screen-rental" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9677" src="http://meetingtomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iPadAir2.jpg" alt="iPad Air 2 Rentals" width="518" height="259" /></a>
<h3 class="p1"></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><b>#3. <b>Onsite technicians are dedicated to your event</b></b></h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-house AV companies at hotels are often responsible for multiple events happening in the same venue. By bringing in an outside provider of your choice, you pay for dedicated support for your event. Then if you have multiple events at the same location, hiring the same technician through your preferred AV provider will ensure you continue to get the support you need.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Â <b>#4. Experience coordinating multiple events</b></h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is true that in-house AV providers sometimes provide support for events in multiple locations, the best way to ensure youâ€™re getting consistent service is to hire an outside AV company who specializes in nationwide event coordination. Meeting Tomorrow is a full-service provider that not only offers the <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/process">same pricing in all locations</a>, but also provides dedicated event support to ensure quality across every event.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/process" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4145" src="http://meetingtomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/home-process-map.png" alt="home-process-map" width="476" height="331" /></a></span><b>#5. Last minute additions are easy to manage</b></h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how carefully planned the event, sometimes last minute gear additions become necessary. While in-house providers may have a store of equipment onsite, the specific gear you need may not be there or may already be in use at another of the venueâ€™s events. A nationwide, outside provider like Meeting Tomorrow has numerous distribution <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/process" target="_blank">warehouses across the country</a> and can accommodate nearly any last-minute request.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Â <b>#6. More equipment &amp; service options</b></h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An outside AV company will have many more options for <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/nationwide-rentals" target="_blank">AV equipment</a> and <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/services" target="_blank">services</a>. This allows you to select different price options in order to stay within your budget. In addition, with a variety of equipment rentals available nationwide, youâ€™re sure to get exactly what you need to fit your event specifications.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Â <b>#7. No surprise fees added after the event</b></h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you book your event with an outside AV provider, youâ€™ll never be surprised by extra costs after the event. On the other hand, sometimes in-house providers will bill things like extra technician time without letting the client know. A greatÂ outside provider will always get approval for changes in advance so youâ€™re never surprised.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Â <b>#8. Pricing is consistent nationwide</b></h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-house AV costs, services, and equipment often vary depending on location. For those planning events in multiple cities, you can save money by using a outside AV company that provides consistency on-site, one-point of contact, and <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/process" target="_blank">flat-rate pricing</a> in every venue where your events are held.</span></p>
