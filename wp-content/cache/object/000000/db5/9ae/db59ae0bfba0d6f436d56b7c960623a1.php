<h2>Choosing a Projection Screen</h2>

<h2>Types of Projection Screens</h2>
<h3>Tripod Screens</h3>
<a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/portable-tripod-screen-rental" target="_blank">Tripod screens</a> are good for small meeting rooms and are limited toÂ front projection only. They are available in 5' and 8' wide options and have an optionalÂ bottom skirt to cover the standÂ and make everything look professional. Tripod screens are very portable and can be easily set up in 2-3 minutes. They can also be shipped or delivered straight to you anywhereÂ nationwide. If you have a small conference set up and you need something quick that you can set up yourself, tripod screens are the right choice.
<h3>Fastfold Screens</h3>
The second main type of screen is the <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/fastfold-front-rear-projection-screen-rental" target="_blank">fastfold screen</a>. Fastfold screensÂ can get much bigger, starting at 6' x 8' and goingÂ up to 15' x 20', which is very large. They are also available in widescreen format, 16:9 aspect ratio, which is perfect for HD projection. One of the most appealing aspects of fastfold screens isÂ the option of a drape surround dress kit that coversÂ the top, sides, and bottom. This drape package ensures that the screen looks clean and professional.Â Fastfold screens are available in a variety of sizes, are still portable but not as much so, and require an onsite technician to set up.

The fastfold screen is also capable of doing both front and rear projection. Rear projection allows you to keep all equipment (projectors, cables, and everything) behind the screen andÂ out of the way of any presenters that might want to walk in front and point to the screen. This is a good bet if you have a presenter that has a lot of moments inÂ their presentation where they need to point out specific details on the screen.
<h3>Large Truss Screens</h3>
If you're looking for an even bigger screen or a custom size screen, we also have <a href="http://meetingtomorrow.com/truss-screen-rental" target="_blank">large truss screen rentals</a> available in standard definition, HD, widescreen, and ultra-wide formats. Whether flown or stacked, we can provideÂ any size screen you can imagine forÂ both front and rear projection.
