<h1>Helping a medical company with their largest multi-market product launch ever.</h1>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
A medical device company manufactures cutting edge hearing aids to improve the quality of people's lives who are hearing impaired. Their new model of customizable hearing aid has a USB port on it and allows fine tuning of the device by connecting it to a computer. The medical company needed to train resellers and medical professionals across multiple markets on how to calibrate hearing aids best for their customers and patients. They had never done a nationwide product promotion like this before.
<h3><strong>Their results</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Over 1,500 customers and medical professionals educated on their new products.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Product promotions in 150 locations over the course of 3 months.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Successful run of their first nationwide product promotion.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What they needed</strong></h3>
Their sales staff needed to spend time training attendees - not hooking up equipment. They needed simple, reliable and consistent laptops and presentation equipment in major markets that made it easy to hold product demos of their new hearing aids.
<h3><strong>What we delivered</strong></h3>
We provided 10 laptops and an on-site technician at each event location. The laptops were configured and tested to the medical companyâ€™s specifications. We created a program that allowed wiping of data in the field and re-installation of the companyâ€™s custom Windows operating system installation. This removed concerns about shipping sensitive information and standardized all laptops to the same set of applications, settings and data on every laptop in every market. As an added benefit to re-formatting the computers in the field, they were able to cut down on shipping times and costs by cutting out sending them to our national distribution center for servicing.
