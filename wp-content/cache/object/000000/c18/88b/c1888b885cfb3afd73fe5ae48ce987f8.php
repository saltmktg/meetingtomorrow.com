<h1>Transformations in E-Learning</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]One of the most beautiful things about technology is the many ways that it has been adapted to fit the needs of anyone who uses it. New machines are built to perform jobs easier and old machines undergo adjustments and improvements to be on par.

E-learning, or electronic learning, is just another great example of how technology has been changing the world for the better. It began when computers were introduced to the classroom. As educators discovered more about computers, they used different programs to enhance the classroom experience for various kinds of lessons like math, social science, or other classes.

E-learning is for people who attend online or hybrid classes. All of the lessons, or at least most of them, take place far away from the classroom where the classes usually only meet for exams.

Some classes are simply easier to teach using e-learning. Any class which requires heavy use of video or graphics techniques is far easier to teach on the computer and even subjects like math and science can be taught online. Other subjects, like music, can really only be taught in the classroom, but other subjects like history or science can be blended between a traditional classroom and a computer. With these blended classes, students have access to the best of both worlds, reaping the benefit of a knowledgeable teacher at their disposal. Together with the vast information available, e-learners have some unique advantages over traditional students. The classes are very well-rounded and students have access to all the information and guidance that they need to learn their subjects.

Another reason e-learning has become so popular is because students have access to a far greater amount of information using a computer than a course-required textbook. With the internet at their disposal, they have access to millions of web pages and many of those pages have far more information on them than a typical textbook could ever hold. These sources of information can range from government pages that hold only the most trusted information and encyclopedias that students can use whenever they need to look something up quickly. They even have access to online communities where experts gather so they can get answers to harder questions.

E-learning is even finding a home in the workplace. Workers are now able to study while at work as they can obtain degrees and certifications while still working and earning their pay on the job. Some companies even encourage their employees to do this so that they can obtain degrees that make them more valuable workers. This can also provide good support for workers who can get into contact with people who are more knowledgeable so they can get expert help when they run into problems.

What makes e-learning most valuable is the fact that it is completely adaptable. Courses can be molded to fit a person's capabilities and level of education perfectly. Students can learn at the pace that works best for them. Novices will be able to learn the basics while experts can learn the best ways to improve their already impressive skill sets. Flexibility like that is a valuable resource for companies and workers.
