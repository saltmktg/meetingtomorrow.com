<h3>3D Makes Business Sense</h3>
With new advances in technology, 3D is not just for movies anymore. 3D projection is now being used more widely than ever in business to wow audiences at trade shows, make a lasting impact on potential investors during product demos, promote new products to potential customers, and much more.

3D projection is not nearly as simple as setting up a basic projector and screen. Thatâ€™s why companies count on Meeting Tomorrowâ€™s team of experts. We provide the technical know-how, as well as the same impeccable customer service we give for every meeting or event. Our equipment and customized, full-service solutions guarantee irreplaceable results.
<h3>How it Works</h3>
3D begins with original 3D content - either video or images. Therefore, the first step in 3D projection is producing your content in 3D and providing it to Meeting Tomorrow. Your file may be either a stereoscopic recording or computer-rendered 3D video or graphics.

Next, our team of technical experts comes in to help make your vision a reality. (Donâ€™t worry about the technical jargon - youâ€™ll also have a dedicated account manager to answer all of your questions each step of the way). Once you create the content, Meeting Tomorrow will take care of the equipment and setup to ensure optimal viewing results for your audience. All of our solutions are custom-tailored based on the content you provide and type of application, as well as the details of your room, lighting and other specifications.

The 3D content you provide will be displayed on a large, polarization-preserving screen through a combination of specialty projectors and filters. Your audience members will each be provided with a pair of 3D glasses which de-code the images for each eye and provide a 3D effect.[/fusion_text][separator style_type="none" top_margin="" bottom_margin="20" sep_color="" icon="" width="" class="" id=""][one_third last="no" spacing="yes" background_color="" background_image="" background_repeat="no-repeat" background_position="left top" border_size="0px" border_color="" border_style="" padding="" class="" id=""][imageframe lightbox="no" style_type="none" bordercolor="" bordersize="0px" borderradius="0" stylecolor="" align="none" link="" linktarget="_self" animation_type="0" animation_direction="down" animation_speed="0.1" class="" id=""] <img src="http://meetingtomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3d-car.png" alt="" />[/imageframe][/one_third][two_third last="yes" spacing="yes" background_color="" background_image="" background_repeat="no-repeat" background_position="left top" border_size="0px" border_color="" border_style="" padding="" class="" id=""][fusion_text]Auto Industry 3D Projection Package
