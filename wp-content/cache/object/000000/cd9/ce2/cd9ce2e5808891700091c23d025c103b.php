We're looking for Audio Visual and Technology Freelance Technicians and Companies to give our clients the best on-site technical service in the industry. This means setting up gear and providing technical expertise all while being extremely professional and likable. We need experts who have worked a variety of events including dinner meetings, webcasts and technology setups.

Our dinner meetings typically require a 1,500 lumens projector, 6ft tripod screen, wireless lapel microphone, mixer and speaker. This needs to be setup before our clientâ€™s contact person (the rep) arrives on site. When the clientâ€™s rep arrives you'll do a standard "Meet &amp; Greet" and review the setup with them so they're comfortable using the gear.

A webcast has a similar setup to a dinner meeting except there's an internet or satellite feed included. This requires constant monitoring of the internet or satellite connection and webcast platform to make sure the broadcast is being received at your location without any hiccups.

Technology setups have the highest level of customer expectation. We're talking about the newest gear with the best software working flawlessly and impressively in front of our client's target audience. Being an expert in something brand new is difficult to maintain but that's exactly what we expect from our Audio Visual and Technology Partners.
