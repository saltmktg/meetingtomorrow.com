<h1>Helping a global retailer with internal meetings.</h1>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
An global retail leader is constantly offering better products and value to its customers, often opening many new store locations each year. They regularly hold internal town hall meetings, broadcasts and live events to keep their employees updated on products and services. They were looking for new audiovisual on-site support provider that could operate as a wing of their technical division.
<h3><strong>Their results</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>48 events serviced with presentation equipment and on-site support over the course of one year.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>A 100% success rate on pop-up events with less than one week turnaround time.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What they needed</strong></h3>
The retailer had their own technical event specialists in the field but needed to scale the size of their team across multiple markets throughout the United States as needed. They wanted to work with a company that understood the fine technical details required to put on successful events even on short notice.
<h3><strong>What we delivered</strong></h3>
They were assigned an account team educated on the retailer's standard operating procedures. By working with one nationwide provider for all their events they were able to streamline their events and save time and money by not using different local providers in each market. They could rapidly scale events by relying on our qualified on-site technicians who were available in every market the retailer needed to expand to. They were also given access to a wider assortment of specialized equipment that would be too costly for them to keep in-house.
