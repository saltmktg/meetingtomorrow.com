<h1>Understanding Audio Visual Cabling</h1>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text]It is vital when preparing an important business conference that all the equipment is properly set up. Cabling ensures the proper function of equipment and careful placement of cables ensures the safety of meeting attendees.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sound</strong> is the most crucial part of the meeting. Proper cabling ensures that an electrical connection is established to provide enough power output for the level of sound desired.</li>
	<li>Make sure there are enough <strong>electrical outlets</strong> available and that they will not be overloaded. Surge protectors can be used to protect equipment and increase the number of outlets available for safe use.</li>
	<li>Provide <strong>desktop outlets</strong> as a power source to utilize more space in the conference room.</li>
	<li>For safety and aesthetics, use <strong>cable protectors</strong> to cover cables running across the conference room floor. If cable protectors are not available, consider black duct or gaffer tape. You can also cover short lengths of cable with office rugs. Run cables along the wall rather than through the middle of the room if possible.</li>
	<li>Consider how many pieces of <strong>electronic equipment</strong> will be used and where to plug all of it into outlets. Calculate the distance between each piece and determine how long the cords need to be in order to connect the equipment together when necessary.</li>
	<li><strong>Test all equipment</strong> before the meeting and look for any possible safety hazards while checking for malfunctions.</li>
	<li>Arrange the <strong>sound system</strong> in an unobtrusive manner and make sure the volume is set in advance.</li>
	<li>Check all <strong>visual diagrams</strong> to make sure cable and plugs are placed properly. Each blueprint or instruction sheet will have step by step directions and describe placement of cables according to size and color charts.</li>
	<li><strong>Double check</strong> the inputs on each piece of <a href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/audio-equipment-sound-rentals">sound equipment</a> or other audiovisual to make sure your cabling is effective, including items such as Mac adapters for LCD projectors or miniplug adapters for connecting laptops to sound systems.</li>
	<li>Most audio visual equipment comes with specific instructions and diagrams. Reference the instructions for all equipment that will be used at the meeting. It is very helpful to sketch the room layouts and configure placement of all audiovisual items and cabling. Measure the actual room to determine space between placement of laptops, audio recorders, or TVs. Factor in the measurement of cords and connecting cables. Eyeballing the space can be helpful at first, but make sure to double check the actual size of the room. This especially helps to make sure you have enough slack to safely cover and conceal the cabling.
